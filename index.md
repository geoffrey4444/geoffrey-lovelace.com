## About me

I am a professor in the [Department of Physics](http://physics.fullerton.edu/) at [California State University, Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu). My current research interests focus on using numerical relativity to model sources of gravitational waves, such as merging black holes. I join professors Jocelyn Read, Josh Smith, and Al Agnew in Cal State Fullerton's [Nicholas and Lee Begovich Center for Gravitatinal-Wave Physics and Astronomy (GWPAC)](http://physics.fullerton.edu/gwpac/), and I also am a member of the [Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) collaboration](http://www.black-holes.org/) and the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](http://ligo.org/).

[GWPAC](http://news.fullerton.edu/gravitational-waves/) and the SXS collaboration are contributing to [LIGO's discovery of gravitational waves](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211).

## Research

At Cal State Fullerton, my research goals focus on modeling sources of gravitational waves using numerical relativity. Gravitational waves—ripples of spacetime curvature—are opening a new window on the universe. The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) has observed the [first gravitational waves](http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1602.03837) passing through Earth, which came from merging black holes. My students and I use [supercomputers](http://physics.fullerton.edu/gwpac/news/highlights/172-orca-upgrade) to simulate colliding black holes using the [Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC)](http://black-holes.org/SpEC.html), and we are particularly interested in modeling  [merging black holes that spin nearly as fast as possible](http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1412.1803) and in [responding to LIGO observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1607.05377). I recently have begun using supercomputers to [model thermal noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07774) in LIGO mirrors, with the goal of helping to improve the sensitivity of next-generation detectors, and exploring [how well gravitatioanl-wave detectors can measure rapid black-hole spins](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03704).

I am contributing to the development of [SpECTRE](http://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre), the SXS Collaboration's next-generation numerical-relativity code. Jocelyn Read, Josh Smith, and I area also contributing to charting a course for the next generation of gravitational-wave science in the United Sates, looking at concepts like [Cosmic Explorer](cosmicexplorer.org).

Starting in 2018, I am leading an annual one-week summer
[workshop](Workshop/2021) that introduces students from local
community colleges to gravitational waves and high-performance
computing.

## Teaching

I have taught the following courses:

* Astronomy 101, an interactive, general introduction to astronomy.

* Astronomy 444, "Applications of Gravitation," a new course for advanced undergraduates that I am piloting, focusing on some applications of general relativity: black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology.

* Physics 211, "Elementary Physics," an algebra-based introduction to mechanics and thermodynamics.

* Physics 211L, "Elementary Physics Laboratory", the laboratory co-requisite to Physics 211.

* Physics 225, "Fundamental Physics," a calculus-based introduction to mechanics. I have [redesigned](https://contentbuilder.merlot.org/toolkit/html/snapshot.php?id=97541425467973) this course using a flipped classroom, supported in part by the [CSU Sustaining Success](courseredesign.csuprojects.org/wp/sustaining-success/) and [Proven Course Resdesign](courseredesign.csuprojects.org/wp/proven/) redesign programs.

* Physics 300, "Survey of Mathematical Physics", a course that bridges the under-division and upper-division undergraduate physics major courses, introducing key mathematical tools while emphasizing how to think about math like a physicist.

* Physics 330A and 330B, "Electromagnetic Theory I and II", an upper-division course on electromagnetic theory.

* Physics 520, "Analytical Mechanics," a master's-level course in classical mechanics and special relativity.

### What merging black holes look like

The source of LIGO's first observation of gravitational waves was a pair of merging black holes. This movie shows what the merging black holes would look like up close, in slow motion (about 100 times slower than real time). Credit: SXS Collaboration.
