These are materials from the 2019 [Cal State
Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu) Workshop on High-Performance
Computing and Gravitational Waves. The workshop is scheduled to be held 
at Cal State Fullerton's [Gravitational-Wave Physics and Astronomy
Center](https://physics.fullerton.edu/gwpac), on August 19, 2019 -- August 23,
2019.

## Links
  * [Notebook to explore data from SXS Catalog of simulations of merging black holes](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sxs-collaboration/catalog_tools/master?filepath=Examples%2Fsxs_bbh_example.ipynb) - This notebook will let you interact with data from different simulations in the SXS Catalog. It will show you how to make plots of the black-hole masses, and it will show you how to plot and turn into a sound the emitted gravitational waves.
