# 2022 Workshop on High-Performance Computing and Gravitational Waves

These are materials from the 2022 [Cal State
Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu) Workshop on High-Performance
Computing and Gravitational Waves.

The workshop is scheduled to be held
online through Cal State Fullerton's [Nicholas and Lee Begovich Center for Gravitational-Wave Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.fullerton.edu/gwpac), on August 16, 2022 -- August 20, 2022. The zoom link will be provided to accepted applicants in advance of the workshop.

## Applying

## Links
  * [Notebook to explore data from SXS Catalog of simulations of merging black holes](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sxs-collaboration/catalog_tools/master?filepath=Examples%2Fsxs_bbh_example.ipynb) - This notebook will let you interact with data from different simulations in the SXS Catalog. It will show you how to make plots of the black-hole masses, and it will show you how to plot and turn into a sound the emitted gravitational waves.
